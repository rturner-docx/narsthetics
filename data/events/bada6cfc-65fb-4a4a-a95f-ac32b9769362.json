(In the interview, he notes that the band was named after Pike’s Peak, the mountain atop which a depressed poet wrote the poem that became the song “America the Beautiful.”) Yet the same principle of concision and interpretability was applied to his earlier writing, both in the band Silver Jews — established with Steven Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich of Pavement — and his poetry. “Governors on Sominex” is from Berman’s only published collection, Actual Air (1999).

He suffered from depression and substance abuse across his life, and nearly-fatally overdosed in 2003. His lyrics are funny, though, even hopeful, in a caustic way. (He may be most well-known for the lyric that opens the Silver Jews album American Water (1998): “in 1984, I was hospitalized for approaching perfection.”) The lines are uplifting, even if the actual air that buoys does nothing but return you to your feet. The transmutation of language and experience into lyric, then, is a mutation that makes experience livable. Again, the narcotic capacity of aesthetic production is productive for a subject, flipping the rhetoric of narcotic’s trope that sensory modification is inherently pacifying, extractive, or impotent.

That’s in the long-term, though; in the short term, there’s only the risk of paranoia, and sleepwalking. "

It had been four days of no weather / as if nature had conceded its genius to the indoors puts us in a speculative mode, like simile always does. What begins as mere description of a scene becomes a meditation on the possibility that technoculture — an extension of “genius” — may cease mimicking nature, and nature may no longer be that godly perfection genius strives to reproduce. (Maybe too Kantian for this poem, I know.) A colloquial observation is defamiliarized by a line break and a word or two, by a speculative mode catalyzed in the “as if” that makes readers move back and forth between the literal and the figurative. For example, the Bureau of Sad Endings could either be a figure for something or an actual administrative agency; it could be that in this little poem-world of sleeping governors, narrative is given an ideological value predetermined by the state. Stories, then, are narcotizing. "

Parataxis has a way of flattening all disparate phrases into a single affect. And the poem becomes nearly narrative in the middle two acts: a cast of characters emerges, each character having already been failed by some institution or structure (the penal system, the social welfare system, common language, one’s own brain). We never get to the sad ending, though, because the sadnesses are all ongoing. We follow the light into whatever, we try a new kind of sleep, we keep using nuggets of language that don’t quite get at what we mean. The last few lines — spoken, I imagine, through the perspective of the bell-pepper-sailor — get at this ongoingness. There were no new ways to understand the world, / only new days to set our understandings against is not opposed to Each page was a new chance to understand the last, though it first seems that way. Maybe there are no more new “logics” in postmodernity, no more ways to arrange ideas and the language that represents them, but we can always find new comparisons, write new similes. "

Even if we’ll never understand some big, vast things — the sea was always there to make you feel stupid — understanding isn’t really the point. A desire for life is latent in the attempt to understand, at all, even if sometimes we have to medicate through it. "
