If we do the same drugs — or, share the same taste — we can at least trick ourselves into sharing a world. "

Though I don’t stand by Nietzsche’s contention that narcotic (or ascetic) experiences, symptomatic of and systematized by a widespread epistemological trance, always impede individual flourishing, I wouldn’t dare argue in favor of collective euphoria for the sake of something like liberal democracy, because like, leave me alone. Enough literature exists about the relation between substance abuse and aesthetic production, at least through the early twentieth century when “artist” became synonymous with “addict” and the academy (somewhat) internalized the Nietszchean (and, I guess, Platonic) suspicion of rhetoric and aesthetics as narcotic. I’m interested not whether aesthetic experience produces a trance, but what the trance has to do with aesthetic experience; or, what moments of willed sensory modification do to the experience of art and self.

For example: a glass of wine changes someone’s sensorium as they drink it, but the quality of the wine also changes with oxygenation, subjecting both drinker and drunk to a temporalized aesthetic situation that is either pleasurable or sickening, proof of “good taste” or philistinism. Or: Don DeLillo’s White Noise can be read to argue that suspicion and fear (and their manifestations as academic method) can be as narcotizing as pills and air pollution. "
