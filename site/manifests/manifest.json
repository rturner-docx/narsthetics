These objects are not necessarily \"about\" narcotics; though they often discuss or concern narcotic experience, the drug and/or the drink is not a mere plot point, not does it service conflict, resolution, or parable.\nEach object offers an opportunity to interpret the role of sensory modification in aesthetic and/or everyday experience, but they also offer methods for experiential experimentation that challenge the cultural assumption that clarity/cleanliness/sobriety is morally good. These objects, I argue, beg us to ask more interesting questions about narcotics/sensory modification/our vices than: are they good or bad?
